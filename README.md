# AI Chess Game

Our Java AI chess program, developed with Netbeans 17 and Java 8, builds upon our previous [2-player GUI chess game](https://github.com/Rhuyk/COMP603-Project-2-Chess) by incorporating an AI mode. Using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, our program offers an immersive chess-playing experience. Whether you enjoy challenging the AI or playing against a friend, our program supports both single-player and two-player modes. Furthermore, you can conveniently save and load previous games using the embedded database, enabling you to review historic moves and continue your chess journey at your own pace.
